> To help you developing Merchant Center Applications, be sure to check out our [ui-kit](https://github.com/commercetools/ui-kit) components library.

## Getting started

If you are developing a Merchant Center application, you can start by installing one of our [templates](./application-templates) using the `create-mc-app` CLI.

```bash
$ npm install --global @commercetools-frontend/create-mc-app
$ create-mc-app my-new-custom-application-project --template starter

# or

$ npx @commercetools-frontend/create-mc-app my-new-custom-application-project --template starter
```

## Developing application-kit packages

### Initial Installation

1. Clone this repo

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit.git
   ```

2. Add necessary environment variables

   > Navigate to `merchant_center_application_kit/playground`, duplicate `.env.local.template`, name the duplicate `.env.local` and add these values:

   ```bash
     MC_API_URL="https://mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com" # for prod
     APP_ID="" # can be an empty string for dev
     CTP_INITIAL_PROJECT_KEY=<your-project-name> # the name of any project you have access to on prod/stage
   ```

3. Build and run the application kit

   > In a new terminal window, navigate to the project root directory - `/merchant_center_application_kit` - and run:

   ```bash
   $ yarn && yarn prebuild && yarn build && yarn build:watch
   ```

   > Confirm that the watch is running successfully, you should see:

   ```bash
   > "info @commercetools-frontend/application-shell waiting for changes..."
   >...
   ```

4. Remove fake permission:
   > `PERMISSIONS.ViewPlaygroundStateMachines` which is required by playground is a fake permission and you might need to remove it
   > in order to be able to run and view the application. You'll need to remove it twice in `custom-application-config.mjs` and once in
   > `routes.js` so that `permissions`/`demandedPermissions` are just empty objects:

`custom-application-config.mjs`

```bash
 permissions: [PERMISSIONS.ViewPlaygroundStateMachines],
 submenuLinks: [
    {
      uriPath: 'echo-server',
      permissions: [PERMISSIONS.ViewPlaygroundStateMachines],
      defaultLabel: '${intl:en:Menu.EchoServer}',
      labelAllLocales: [
        {
          locale: 'en',
          value: '${intl:en:Menu.EchoServer}',
        },
        {
          locale: 'de',
          value: '${intl:de:Menu.EchoServer}',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
```

`routes.js`

```bash
   const canViewStateMachines = useIsAuthorized({
     demandedPermissions: [PERMISSIONS.ViewPlaygroundStateMachines],
   });
```

5. Build and run the [playground application](./playground):

> In a new terminal window, navigate to the project root directory - `/merchant_center_application_kit`, and run:

```bash
$ yarn playground:build && yarn playground:start
```

> This should open a browser window and the standard merchant cernter login prompt, login using your account, and then the playground should load in the browser if permissions are set correctly (I am unclear on what those perms are or how to set them, so this is completely theoretical on my part at this point)

### RUNNING THE APP KIT AND PLAYGROUND AFTER INITIAL INSTALLATION

> The playground application consumes the app-kit dependencies as es modules, which means you need to bundle the packages first. We recommend to bundle the packages in watch mode in one terminal process and start the playground app in another terminal process.

- Open 2 terminal windows

  - In the first terminal run

    ```bash
      $ yarn build:watch
    ```

  - Once the watch process has completed and is listening, in the second terminal window run

    ```bash
      $ yarn playground:start
    ```

## To run the tests:

```bash
$ yarn test

# or
$ yarn test:watch
```

## To Build the application bundles:

```bash
$ yarn build

# or
$ yarn build:bundles:watch
```
